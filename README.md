# FYP_FacialRecognition
Facial Recognition for Students Attendance in Examination is an initiative to improve
the efficiency of examination system in educational institution especially in Universiti
Teknologi MARA (UiTM). By using the technology of biometrics, the burden of
responsibilities for invigilators can be reduced. The invigilators are required to do a
tedious task in which to ensure that examinees’ information is legit to verify the
students’ attendance. Other than that, this project has reduced the possibilities for
impersonation of identity during examination. This project focused on facial
recognition because it can provide a higher security and provide a higher accuracy in
authenticating examinees’ attendance compared to the other types of methods used in
taking attendance. The attendance system used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
specifically with FaceNet model. The technique and model are chosen due to the
capabilities of both method in recognizing facial features. Other examples on
attendance system example have also been mentioned but for this project, a biometric
attendance system will be used to authenticate examinees’ identity for attendance. The
development of the project followed Waterfall model of System Development
Lifecycle(SDLC) with 7 phases. The first phase was the requirement analysis in which
the basic understanding about the examination system in UiTM and techniques of
facial recognition by reading journals, websites and articles. In the system design, the
frontend and backend architecture were designed as well as collecting the necessary
data for the system which are 4 images of 5 persons. Then, the embeddings of the
image were extracted and store in the database. Next, the implementation of the
proposed design is created such as the frontend of the system. Then, the images were
fed into pre-trained model (FaceNet) for facial recognition task. Lastly, testing of the
system was done by checking the functionality of the system by went through every
single unit of the system.
